# React-TypeScript Boilerplate
### This is a React-TypeScript project created with `vite` which is using ESlint for linting.  
Run `npm install` and you are good to go.


## Note
If you encounter an error or warning from ESLint indicating a compatibility issue with TypeScript, specifically stating that the current version is not supported, you can follow these steps to resolve the issue:
- then please do install the recomended version of typescript in warning/error 
- Re-install the same TypeScript version provided in the project.
This worked for me twice. I dont know the reason behind it.
