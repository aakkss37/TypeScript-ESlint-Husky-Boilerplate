# React-TypeScript Boilerplate
### This is a React-TypeScript project created with `vite` which is using ESlint for linting.  
Run `npm install` and you are good to go.


## Note
If you get any error or warning form ESlint, saying compatibility issue with TypeScript the current version is not supported then please do install the recomended version of typescript in worning/error and then re-install the same TypeScript version provided in the project.
This thing worked for me twice. I dont know the reason behind it.
